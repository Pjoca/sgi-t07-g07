Inside the **tp1** folder, we can find essential files for a **THREE.js** computer graphics project such as **index.html**, **main.js**, **MyApp.js**, **MyContents.js**, etc.

This folder also has three subdirectories:

- **custom/**: This folder contains all the code for the custom scene objects that we created using the THREE.js library tools.
- **textures/**: This folder holds all the textures applied to the different materials in the scene.
- **screenshots/**: This folder contains all the relevant screenshots of the project.
